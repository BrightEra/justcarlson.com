# Requirements Archive: v0.4.1 Image & Caption Support

**Archived:** 2026-02-02
**Status:** SHIPPED
**Core Value:** A clean, personal space to write — with a publishing workflow that just works.

This is the archived requirements specification for v0.4.1.
For current project status, see `.planning/PROJECT.md`.

## v0.4.1 Requirements

Requirements for image and caption support in blog posts.

### Hero Images

- [x] **HERO-01**: heroImage renders with proper alt text from frontmatter
- [x] **HERO-02**: heroImage supports optional caption (figcaption)
- [x] **HERO-03**: Schema includes `heroImageAlt` field
- [x] **HERO-04**: Schema includes `heroImageCaption` field (optional)

### Inline Images

- [x] **IMG-01**: Inline `<figure>`/`<figcaption>` renders with correct styling (validate existing)

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Image lightbox/zoom | Polish feature, not blocking caption support |
| Automatic image optimization for heroImage | heroImage is already a string URL, optimization is separate concern |
| Image lazy loading improvements | Already has `loading="lazy"`, works fine |

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| HERO-01 | 18 | Complete |
| HERO-02 | 18 | Complete |
| HERO-03 | 18 | Complete |
| HERO-04 | 18 | Complete |
| IMG-01 | 18 | Complete |
