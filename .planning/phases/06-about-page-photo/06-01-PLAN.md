<objective>
Add personal photo to About page using Astro's Image component for optimization.

Purpose: Complete Phase 6 by integrating the user's personal photo with proper web optimization (WebP, responsive variants, retina support).

Output:
- `src/assets/images/about-photo.jpg` — Source photo copied from ~/Downloads/IMG_0251.jpg
- `src/pages/about.mdx` — Updated to use Astro Image component with optimization settings
</objective>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Copy source photo to assets directory</name>
  <files>src/assets/images/about-photo.jpg</files>
  <action>
    Copy the user's photo from ~/Downloads/IMG_0251.jpg to src/assets/images/about-photo.jpg.

    The source photo is 585x780 JPEG. Astro will optimize it during build via Sharp.

    Command:
    ```bash
    cp ~/Downloads/IMG_0251.jpg src/assets/images/about-photo.jpg
    ```

    Verify the file exists and has correct size (~216KB).
  </action>
  <verify>
    ```bash
    ls -la src/assets/images/about-photo.jpg
    file src/assets/images/about-photo.jpg
    ```
    Should show JPEG file ~216KB in correct location.
  </verify>
  <done>Photo file exists at src/assets/images/about-photo.jpg</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update about.mdx with Astro Image component</name>
  <files>src/pages/about.mdx</files>
  <action>
    Replace the placeholder `<img>` tag with Astro's `<Image />` component.

    Changes to about.mdx:

    1. Add import for Image component and photo asset after frontmatter:
    ```astro
    import { Image } from 'astro:assets';
    import aboutPhoto from '../assets/images/about-photo.jpg';
    ```

    2. Replace line 11 (the placeholder img tag):
    ```html
    <img src="/[YOUR-PHOTO-FILENAME].jpg" alt="[YOUR NAME] photo" class="w-full h-auto rounded-lg" />
    ```

    With:
    ```astro
    <Image
      src={aboutPhoto}
      alt="Justin Carlson"
      format="webp"
      quality={80}
      widths={[320, 640, 800]}
      sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 281px"
      loading="eager"
      densities={[1, 2]}
      class="w-full h-auto rounded-lg"
    />
    ```

    Key settings per RESEARCH.md and CONTEXT.md:
    - format="webp" — 30% smaller than JPEG
    - quality={80} — Good balance (Sharp default)
    - widths={[320, 640, 800]} — Mobile, retina mobile, desktop breakpoints
    - sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 281px" — Full-width mobile, 281px max desktop
    - loading="eager" — Above fold, no lazy loading
    - densities={[1, 2]} — Standard + Retina support
    - class="w-full h-auto rounded-lg" — Existing styling with subtle rounded corners

    The existing layout structure (flex-col md:flex-row, right-side placement) is already correct per CONTEXT.md decisions.

    ```bash
    # Verify imports added
    grep -n "import { Image }" src/pages/about.mdx
    grep -n "import aboutPhoto" src/pages/about.mdx

    # Verify Image component used (not raw img tag)
    grep -n "<Image" src/pages/about.mdx

    # Verify placeholder removed
    grep "YOUR-PHOTO-FILENAME" src/pages/about.mdx && echo "FAIL: Placeholder still present" || echo "PASS: Placeholder removed"

    # Run build to verify image optimization works
    npm run build 2>&1 | tail -20
    ```
    Should show imports present, Image component used, no placeholder, build succeeds.
  </verify>
  <done>
    - Astro Image component imports present
    - Photo renders with WebP optimization
    - Build succeeds without errors
    - Placeholder img tag replaced
  </done>

1. `npm run build` completes successfully
2. `grep "Image" src/pages/about.mdx` shows Image component import and usage
3. `ls src/assets/images/about-photo.jpg` shows file exists
4. `npm run preview` and visit /about — photo displays beside intro text
5. DevTools Network tab shows optimized image served (WebP format, appropriate size)
