<objective>
Delete all previous owner's content from the repository.

Purpose: Clean slate for Just Carlson's blog - remove all Peter Steinberger's blog posts, images, and avatar files so the site contains only placeholder content ready for new posts.

Output: Empty content directories with no blog posts or images from the previous owner.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Delete all blog posts</name>
  <files>src/content/blog/**/*.md</files>
  <action>
Delete all blog content directories and markdown files:
- Count files first: `find src/content/blog -name "*.md" | wc -l` (expect ~107)
- Delete all year directories: `git rm -r src/content/blog/2012 src/content/blog/2013 src/content/blog/2014 src/content/blog/2015 src/content/blog/2016 src/content/blog/2017 src/content/blog/2018 src/content/blog/2019 src/content/blog/2020 src/content/blog/2021 src/content/blog/2025`
- Also delete any loose posts: `git rm src/content/blog/*.md` (if any exist at root level)
- Commit with message: `chore(content): delete all previous blog posts`

Do NOT delete the src/content/blog/ directory itself - keep it for future posts.
  </action>
  <verify>
- `find src/content/blog -name "*.md" | wc -l` returns 0
- `ls src/content/blog/` shows empty or no year directories
- Git shows the deletion commit
  </verify>
  <done>All 107 blog posts deleted from src/content/blog/, directory structure cleared</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Delete all blog images</name>
  <files>public/assets/img/**/*</files>
  <action>
Delete all blog image directories:
- Count first: `find public/assets/img -type f | wc -l`
- Delete year directories: `git rm -r public/assets/img/2015 public/assets/img/2016 public/assets/img/2017 public/assets/img/2018 public/assets/img/2019 public/assets/img/2020 public/assets/img/2021 public/assets/img/2025`
- Commit with message: `chore(content): delete all blog images`

Do NOT delete the public/assets/img/ directory itself - keep for future use.
Preserve any non-year directories (if they exist and contain theme assets).
  </action>
  <verify>
- `ls public/assets/img/20*` returns "No such file or directory"
- Git shows the deletion commit
  </verify>
  <done>All blog images deleted from public/assets/img/ year directories</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Delete Peter's avatar/office images</name>
  <files>
    public/peter-office.jpg
    public/peter-office-2.jpg
  </files>
  <action>
Delete Peter's personal images from public/:
- `git rm public/peter-office.jpg public/peter-office-2.jpg`
- Commit with message: `chore(content): delete Peter's avatar images`

These images are referenced in the About page - that page will be replaced in Plan 02.
  </action>
  <verify>
- `ls public/peter-*.jpg` returns "No such file or directory"
- Git shows the deletion commit
  </verify>
  <done>Peter's avatar/office images deleted from public/</done>
</task>

After all tasks complete:
1. `find src/content/blog -name "*.md" | wc -l` returns 0
2. `ls public/assets/img/20*` fails (no year directories)
3. `ls public/peter-*.jpg` fails (no Peter images)
4. `git log --oneline -3` shows three deletion commits

<success_criteria>
- Zero blog posts remain in src/content/blog/
- Zero blog images remain in public/assets/img/ year directories
- Zero Peter avatar/office images remain in public/
- All deletions committed to git with descriptive messages
</success_criteria>
