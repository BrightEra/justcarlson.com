# Phase 1: Foundation - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-28
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Core configuration and visual assets updated to Just Carlson identity. This includes site config files, social links, color scheme application, and favicon generation. Component updates and content changes are separate phases.

## Implementation Decisions

### Monogram Design
- Side-by-side "JC" arrangement (not stacked or interlocked)
- Use ~/Downloads/favicon.svg as reference: bold sans-serif, centered text
- Theme-adaptive: light bg variant for light mode, dark bg variant for dark mode
- Reference has dark background (#222222) with white text

### Author Identity
- Display name: "Just Carlson" (full name, not initials or username style)
- Tone: Casual/personal (not professional or minimal)
- Tagline: Claude to draft options — mix of tech/engineering and broad curiosity themes
- Bio should feel personality-forward, not role/title focused

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact adaptive favicon background colors (should work well with site theme)
- Specific tagline wording (will propose options for user to choose)
- Color scheme application details (Leaf Blue light / AstroPaper v4 dark boundaries)
- Social link placement and visibility (GitHub, LinkedIn)

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Favicon reference file: ~/Downloads/favicon.svg — bold sans-serif JC on dark square
- "I write about things I find interesting" energy for the bio, but with tech angle
- Theme-adaptive favicon rather than single dark version
