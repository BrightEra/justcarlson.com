<current_state>
Running `/gsd:discuss-phase 8` to gather implementation context before planning.

We were in the **Post Discovery** area of the discussion.
User selected all 4 gray areas to discuss: Post discovery, Validation behavior, Output and feedback, Image handling.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Gray area analysis complete
- User selected all 4 areas for discussion
- **Post Discovery** - 2 of 4 questions answered:
  - Q1: Where should posts live? → **Specific folder** (not anywhere in vault)
  - Q2: What folder path? → **Posts/** (top-level Posts folder)
  - Q3: Draft status handling → INTERRUPTED before answer
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

**Post Discovery** (resume here):
- Q3: How should draft status work? (explicit `status: - Published` required vs missing = publishable vs `status: - Draft` to exclude)
- Q4: TBD based on Q3 answer
- Check: More questions or move to next area?

**Validation behavior** (not started):
- What happens when validation fails?
- Required vs optional fields?
- Error messaging approach?

**Output and feedback** (not started):
- Verbosity levels?
- Dry-run format?
- Success/failure messaging?

**Image handling** (not started):
- How to find referenced images?
- Destination naming?
- Missing image handling?

**After all areas**: Write 08-CONTEXT.md
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Posts must live in a **specific folder** (not scan entire vault)
- Folder path is **Posts/** at vault root
</decisions_made>

<context>
This is the discuss-phase workflow before research/planning. The goal is to capture enough implementation decisions in CONTEXT.md that downstream agents (researcher, planner) don't need to ask the user again.

We're using AskUserQuestion with multiSelect to let user pick areas, then 4 questions per area with a "more or next?" checkpoint.

Phase 8 is "something users RUN" — a CLI workflow. Gray areas focus on:
- Discovery behavior (where to look, what counts as publishable)
- Validation behavior (fail modes, required fields)
- Output/feedback (what to show, verbosity)
- Image handling (finding, copying, naming)
</context>

<next_action>
Resume `/gsd:discuss-phase 8`:
1. Ask Q3 about draft status handling (the interrupted question)
2. Continue through remaining Post Discovery questions
3. Check "more or next?" then proceed to Validation behavior
4. After all 4 areas, write 08-CONTEXT.md
</next_action>
