    <p>Ten years in technical support. Troubleshooting, escalations, infrastructure problems. That work taught me how to diagnose systems and break down complex issues. Now I apply those skills to building.</p>
    <p>Claude Code and similar AI tools let me ship software I couldn't write alone. I learn in public.</p>
    <p>Based in Greater Boston.</p>
    <p>When not coding, I run a Proxmox homelab. Docker containers, Linux VMs, self-hosted services. Currently learning Kubernetes. Started as a way to understand customer infrastructure. Became its own thing.</p>

## GitHub Activity

<GitHubChart />

My first public project is [QuickTab](https://github.com/justcarlson/QuickTab), a Chrome extension for Zendesk power users. Built it with Claude Code after resurrecting a five-year-old codebase. Wrote about that [here](/posts/2026/claude-code-helped-me-resurrect-a-five-year-old-codebase).
